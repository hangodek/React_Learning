In this example, the pink dot should move when the checkbox is on, and should stop moving when the checkbox is off. The logic for this has already been implemented: the handleMove event handler checks the canMove state variable.

However, for some reason, the canMove state variable inside handleMove appears to be “stale”: it’s always true, even after you tick off the checkbox. How is this possible? Find the mistake in the code and fix it.
